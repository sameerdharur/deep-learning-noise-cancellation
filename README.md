# deep-learning-noise-cancellation

Adapted from Mozilla's RNN Noise project : https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/09/rnnoise-deep-learning-noise-suppression/

The end-product of this project was the creation of an Android app running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE) to perform real-time noise cancellation of audio on a mobile device.
